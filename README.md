# Rustrial OS

A small, in-development educational operating system written in Rust.

This repository is a work-in-progress learning project experimenting with bare-metal programming on x86_64 using Rust. It follows many of the techniques and guidance from Philipp Oppermann's excellent "Writing an OS in Rust" blog series (see Credit section below).

## Status

This project is currently under active development. Expect incomplete features, breaking changes, and manual build steps. The codebase is not yet suitable for production use.

## Repository layout / files of interest

- `Cargo.toml` - crate configuration and dependencies (uses `bootloader`, `volatile`, `spin`, etc.)
- `x86_64-rustrial_os.json` - custom target specification (x86_64, no OS, rust-lld as linker).
- `src/main.rs` - kernel entry point.
- `src/vga_buffer.rs` - VGA text buffer driver used for printing to the screen during early boot.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable or nightly as needed by some tooling). If you run into build errors about unstable features, try installing a recent nightly toolchain and re-running the commands:

```powershell
rustup install nightly
rustup override set nightly
```
- For Linux, it's preferably to use the `Rustup package`
- `rust-lld` / `lld` (the linker used by the custom target). On Windows this generally comes with the LLVM toolchain or via the `lld` package for your toolchain.
- QEMU for running the generated disk/boot image:

  - On Windows, download QEMU for Windows or use your package manager.

- (Optional) `bootimage` â€” convenient helper for creating a bootable disk image. Install with:

```powershell
cargo install bootimage
```
- You also need the `llvm-tools-preview` rustup component installed for running `bootimage` and building the bootloader. Run this command to have it installed: `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`.

## Build

Build the kernel using the provided custom target JSON. From the repository root run:

```powershell
cargo build --target x86_64-rustrial_os.json
```

If you have `bootimage` installed you can build and produce a bootable image in one step:

```powershell
cargo bootimage --target x86_64-rustrial_os.json
```

Note: `bootimage` will place the built image under `target/<target-triple>/<debug|release>/bootimage-<crate>.bin` (or `.../bootimage-<crate>.img` depending on version). Adjust paths below accordingly.

## Run (QEMU)

Once you have a bootable image (either manually created or via `bootimage`), run it in QEMU:

```powershell
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=target/x86_64-rustrial_os/debug/bootimage-rustrial_os.bin 

# or just simply use this command. As configured in the config.toml file, this will run cargo build command for building the kernel, create a bootable image and automatically start QEMU
cargo run
```

This runs the OS in QEMU and connects the serial port to the terminal (`-serial stdio`) so early printk output appears in your console.

## Notes and troubleshooting

- If you see linker errors, ensure `rust-lld` is available and that your Rust toolchain and linker are compatible. The custom target requests `rust-lld` as the linker.
- If `bootimage` fails, try building manually with `cargo build --target ...` and inspect `target/<target>/debug` for artifacts. The bootloader/bootimage versions matter; if needed, pin versions in `Cargo.toml` or consult upstream docs.

## Contributing

Contributions, improvements, and bug fixes are welcome. This project is educational and intentionally small; feel free to open issues or PRs for suggestions, fixes, or enhancements.
